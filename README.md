# Visualizer

**Visualizer** is an interactive web application that allows users to explore and understand sorting and pathfinding algorithms through animations. The platform is designed to enhance learning by providing customizable options and a visual representation of algorithmic behavior.

Developed using **React JS** and **Vanilla CSS**. Showcases beautiful UI coupled with excellent understandings of **algorithms.**

## Features

### Sorting Algorithm Visualization
1. **Dynamic Array Management**:
   - Adjust the size of the array to visualize sorting on different data scales.
   - Regenerate the array with random values for varied testing.
2. **Speed Control**:
   - Choose animation speed: slow, medium, or fast.
3. **Supported Algorithms**:
   - Selection Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Bubble Sort
   - Heap Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Quick Sort

### Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization
1. **Supported Algorithms**:
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2. **Interactive Grid**:
   - Set and adjust starting and ending points dynamically.
   - Add obstacles and walls to customize the grid for more complex scenarios.
3. **Speed Control**:
   - Adjust the animation speed to slow, medium, or fast.
